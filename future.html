		<h3>My gSchool Goals</h3>
		<p>I've taken various programming and web design classes over the years, but as you can see by looking at this website, my learning hasn't really jelled yet. I have fun with colors and trying different techniques, but mostly I'm just experimenting. My website isn't the least bit modern-looking or mobile-friendly. I am very much looking forward to learning modern web design and programming techniques, and I'm thrilled with how much I've learned already. Two weeks ago I didn't even know what jQuery was, and now I can make it look as if a GIF on my page is being turned off and on at the click of a button. So fun!

		<h3>My Goals After gSchool</h3>
		<p>I don't have a specific idea of where I would like to work, other than definitely working somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area. I would prefer to work in the East Bay, since that's where I live; but I understand that jobs are more likely to be in San Francisco or even Silicon Valley, so we'll see what happens. I look forward to working with some great people doing something involving what I will learn at gSchool; that sounds like an excellent scenario to me!

		<h3>I Love Learning Like My Cat Loves This Toy!</h3>
		<p>Like my cat reaching for the flying toy in this GIF, I am reaching for knowledge so I can examine it more closely. I enjoy learning as much as my cat enjoys playing with this toy!
